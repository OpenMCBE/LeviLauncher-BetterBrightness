# BetterBrightness

In vanilla Minecraft, brightness ranges from 0 to 100. With BetterBrightness, the brightness range is extended significantly, allowing for much brighter gameplay (up to 10x normal brightness).

## Features

*   **Android:** The slider range is changed to **0-10**.
    *   Level **1** is equivalent to the old maximum (100).
    *   Level **10** is **10x** brighter than the old maximum.
*   **Windows:** The slider range remains **0-100**.
    *   Level **100** is now **10x** brighter than the old maximum.
